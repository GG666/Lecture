# OOP


## Object-Oriented Programming 



### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a construct that bundles the datas and methods(functions), which are operating on the member datas.

Encapsulation also is a mechanism for restricting access to some of componants of objects.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the details. Which is central idea of Object-Orient-Programming. Data abstraction is displaying only the necessary information to the outside.

#### Information hiding

Information hiding is the principle of segregation of the design decisions in a computer program that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed.
